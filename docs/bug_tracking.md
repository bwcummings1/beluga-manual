## Notes on Re-running Integration Tests

- After each bug fix or optimization, re-run the affected integration tests to ensure no regression.
- Update the integration test suite as needed to cover new edge cases discovered during bug fixing.
- Document any changes made to the integration tests in the code comments and update the test documentation accordingly.
