# Beluga User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Guide

## Objective
The purpose of User Acceptance Testing (UAT) is to verify that Beluga meets the business requirements and is ready for deployment to production. This guide outlines the process for conducting UAT sessions, gathering feedback, and iterating on improvements.

## UAT Process

### 1. Preparation

1.1 Identify UAT Participants:
- Select a diverse group of 5-10 users who represent different roles and use cases.
- Include both technical and non-technical users.

1.2 Set Up Test Environment:
- Ensure the UAT environment closely mirrors the production setup.
- Populate the environment with realistic test data.

1.3 Define Test Scenarios:
- Create a list of key user journeys and features to be tested.
- Include both common and edge case scenarios.

### 2. Conducting UAT Sessions

2.1 Orientation:
- Provide a brief introduction to Beluga and its key features.
- Explain the UAT process and objectives to participants.

2.2 Guided Testing:
- Walk participants through the main features of Beluga.
- Demonstrate how to perform key tasks.

2.3 Independent Testing:
- Allow participants to explore Beluga independently.
- Encourage them to try different scenarios and use cases.

2.4 Feedback Collection:
- Use the UAT Feedback Form to collect structured feedback.
- Encourage participants to provide detailed comments and suggestions.

### 3. Feedback Analysis and Iteration

3.1 Compile Feedback:
- Aggregate all feedback from the UAT Feedback Forms.
- Identify common themes and critical issues.

3.2 Prioritize Issues:
- Categorize issues based on severity and impact.
- Create a prioritized list of improvements and fixes.

3.3 Iterate and Improve:
- Address high-priority issues immediately.
- Plan for longer-term improvements based on user suggestions.

3.4 Follow-up:
- Communicate changes and improvements to UAT participants.
- Consider conducting a second round of UAT if significant changes are made.

## UAT Scenarios

1. Chat Interface:
   - Start a new chat session
   - Send and receive messages
   - Toggle Deep Research mode
   - Use different research modes

2. DeepResearch:
   - Initiate a deep research query
   - Monitor research progress
   - Review and interact with research results

3. User Management:
   - Create a new user account
   - Log in and out
   - Update user preferences

4. Performance and Reliability:
   - Test system responsiveness under normal usage
   - Attempt concurrent operations
   - Verify system stability during extended use

5. Integration with External Tools:
   - Test any integrations with third-party tools or APIs

## UAT Success Criteria

- 90% of test scenarios completed successfully
- No critical bugs or blockers identified
- Overall user satisfaction rating of 4 out of 5 or higher

## Timeline

- UAT Duration: 2 weeks
- Feedback Analysis: 3 days
- Initial Fixes and Improvements: 1 week
- Follow-up UAT (if needed): 1 week

## Conclusion

User Acceptance Testing is a critical step in ensuring that Beluga meets user needs and expectations. By following this guide and carefully considering user feedback, we can deliver a high-quality, user-friendly AI research assistant.
