## User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

User Acceptance Testing is a critical phase in our development process, ensuring that Beluga meets user needs and expectations before deployment to production.

### UAT Process

1. Preparation
   - Identify UAT participants (5-10 users representing different roles)
   - Set up a test environment mirroring production
   - Define test scenarios covering key user journeys

2. Conducting UAT Sessions
   - Provide orientation to participants
   - Guide participants through main features
   - Allow independent exploration
   - Collect feedback using the UAT Feedback Form

3. Feedback Analysis and Iteration
   - Compile and analyze feedback
   - Prioritize issues and improvements
   - Implement high-priority fixes
   - Plan for longer-term improvements

### UAT Documentation

- User Acceptance Testing Guide: Detailed instructions for conducting UAT sessions
- UAT Feedback Form: Structured form for collecting user feedback
- UAT Findings Tracker: Document for tracking and prioritizing UAT findings

### Running UAT Sessions

1. Schedule UAT sessions with identified participants
2. Ensure the test environment is properly set up and populated with test data
3. Conduct UAT sessions following the UAT guide
4. Collect completed UAT Feedback Forms from all participants
5. Update the UAT Findings Tracker with identified issues and suggestions

### Analyzing UAT Results

1. Review all completed UAT Feedback Forms
2. Aggregate feedback and identify common themes
3. Update the UAT Findings Tracker with prioritized issues
4. Create action items for addressing high-priority issues
5. Schedule follow-up meetings to discuss longer-term improvements

### UAT Success Criteria

- 90% of test scenarios completed successfully
- No critical bugs or blockers identified
- Overall user satisfaction rating of 4 out of 5 or higher

### Iterating Based on UAT Feedback

1. Address high-priority issues immediately
2. Incorporate user suggestions into the product roadmap
3. Consider conducting additional UAT sessions for significant changes
4. Communicate improvements and changes to UAT participants

Remember, UAT is an iterative process. Be prepared to conduct multiple rounds of testing and refinement to ensure Beluga fully meets user needs and expectations.
